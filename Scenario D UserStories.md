How often do you need to search up PC components?
Not very often. Want to learn more about computers. Want to browse a catalogue. Figure out what they do. Where are they placed? Want to know the price of the components

Do you know the names of any of the PC components?
Knows what a Mouse and keyboard is. Heard of a processor, maybe know what a motherboard is. Wouldn't know how to install them so they would need help.


Would you like to see a picture of each of the components and how detailed do you want the description to be?
Diagram of the components and where they go. Want to be able to move the components around and change them to cheaper ones if available. Big fonts. 


What technological things do you find easy to use and what do you find difficult?
	Browser, computer and  phone but for very specific uses.


Are you comfortable with giving your credit card information to purchase the parts?
Probably not, but would be able to contact the child for  credit card details and how often it can be used.
