Not very often. Want to learn more about computers. Want to browse a catalogue. Figure out what they do. Where are they placed? Want to know the price of the components

Do you know the names of any of the PC components?

Would you like to see a picture of each of the components and how detailed do you want the description to be?

What technological things do you find easy to use and what do you find difficult?
